# About the OpenSAFELY framework
The OpenSAFELY framework is a new secure analytics platform for electronic health records research in the NHS.

Instead of requesting access for slices of patient data and transporting them elsewhere for analysis, the framework supports developing analytics against dummy data, and then running against the real data within the same infrastructure that the data is stored. Read more at OpenSAFELY.org. In order to conduct emergency analytics and support development of a framework within OpenSAFELY for rapid perational research, this specific analysis utilised the [EBM DataLab template notebook project](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/datalab-notebook-template). These notebooks were deployed within the TPP datastore and finalised results were aproved for publication in line with OpenSAFELY methodolgy. A "meaures" framework is now available in OpenSAFELY to support rapid operational research. Read more in the [OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/).
